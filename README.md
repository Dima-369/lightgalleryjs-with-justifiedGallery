I struggled a bit to setup a nice looking plain gallery, so I made this bare-bones
implementation if anyone else needs a bit of guidance to set up everything correctly :)

[GitHub Pages Demo](https://gira-x.github.io/lightgalleryjs-with-justifiedGallery/)

There are more plugins for lightgallery, but this demo does not use all, just the ones
I find useful.

## Compilation

[PugJS](https://pugjs.org) is used to compile the `.pug` index file which outputs to a HTML file.

The HTML file is also beautified because it is easier to skim over if you do not know PugJS.

### Images

The images are all from the animal category from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/animal).

For performance it would be better to display thumbnail images in the `<img src=...`, but I skipped
this here.
